# Fastfood Ordering and Management System (FOMS)

## Overview

The Fastfood Ordering and Management System (FOMS) is designed to streamline the process of ordering, payment, and order management for both customers and staff at Fastfood restaurants. This Java-based application facilitates easy staff management, menu browsing, order customization, and payment processing.

## Features

- **Menu Management:** Add, update, or remove menu items, including prices, descriptions, and item categories.
- **Order Placement:** Allows customers to place orders, customize food items, and choose between takeaway or dine-in options.
- **Payment Integration:** Secure payment processing for various payment methods, including credit/debit cards and online payment platforms.
- **Order Tracking:** Real-time updates on the status of orders, from new orders to completed orders.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
